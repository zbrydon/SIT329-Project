Module Two – Analog Sensor
• Tilt detection using a potentiometer.
	o Angle affects the rider’s position in the simulation
	o Whether the rider is in the slipstream depends on the rider's position in the
simulation.
• Output is a variable speed fan which is controlled with PWM signals
	o If the rider is in the slip stream the fan speed (LED brightness) is lowered
	o If the rider isn’t in the slip stream the fan speed (LED brightness) is raised
