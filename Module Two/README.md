Module Two – Analog Sensor  
- Tilt detection using a potentiometer.  
	- Angle affects the rider’s position in the simulation  
	- Whether the rider is in the slipstream depends on the rider's position in the simulation.  
- Output is a variable speed fan which is controlled with PWM signals  
	- If the rider is in the slip stream the fan speed (LED brightness) is lowered  
	- If the rider isn’t in the slip stream the fan speed (LED brightness) is raised
